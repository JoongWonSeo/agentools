    "# [AgenTools](https://github.com/JoongWonSeo/agentools) - Async Generator Tools for LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple set of modules, wrappers and utils that are essential for LLM-based assistants and agents using the OpenAI API and function tools. It is useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI API:** Simple wrapper for the OpenAI API to provide mocked endpoints for easy testing without costing money, accumulating the delta chunks from streamed responses into partial responses, and easier token counting/tracking.\n",
    "- **Function Tools:** Easily convert any (async) python function into a function tool that the LLM model can call, with automatic validation and retrying with error messages.\n",
    "- **Structured Data:** Easily define a Pydantic model that can be generated by the LLM model, also with validation and retries.\n",
    "- **Assistants:** Event-based architecture with async generators that yield events that you can iterate through and handle only the events you care about, such as whether you want to stream the response or not, cancel the generation prematurely, or wait for user input (human-in-the-loop) before continuing, etc.\n",
    "- **Copilots:** Integrate right into an editor with stateful system messages to allow the copilot to see the latest state of the editor and function tools to interact with the editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yet to come:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agents:** Autoprompting, self-prompting, chain-of-thought, sketchpads, memory management, planning, and more.\n",
    "- **Multi-Agents**: Communication channels, organization structuring, and more.\n",
